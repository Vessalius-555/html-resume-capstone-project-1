<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>
Over the last decades, greenhouse gases (GHG) such as carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide, which are the main sources of climate change have drawn attention among experts globally. 
Among those gases, carbon dioxide is believed to be the one that contributes the most to climate change which drives many researchers to reduce carbon emissions through developing efficient mitigation strategies. 
In 2021, Vietnam emitted 457.05 million tons of CO2 equivalent representing 0.96% of global emissions in which 334.39 million tones are carbon emissions (carbon dioxide). 
Therefore, in light of elevating awareness about carbon emission, this study focuses on assessing environmental knowledge and behavior of students related to carbon footprint (CF) at Thai Nguyen University of Agriculture and Forestry (TUAF), Vietnam. 
The study used both quantitative and qualitative which utilized direct and indirect survey to retrieve data from students with the total of 207 respondents. 
The study found that 70% of respondents having participated in courses or seminars on environmental education and 65% reporting familiarity with the concept of CF. 
In regards to carbon emissions, the total carbon emissions attributed to TUAF students amount to 333.678 tCO2e per year, with an average of 1.612 tCO2e per student annually with dietary choices were identified as the largest contributor, accounting for 128.078 tCO2e per year, or 0.619 tCO2e per student. 
Conversely, shopping habits generated the lowest emissions, with 12.826 tCO2e annually, or 0.062 tCO2e per student, indicating that shopping is relatively less carbon-intensive compared to other activities. 
The finding of this study highlights Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), goal 13, which is climate action. 
Moreover, this provides valuable lessons for developing more efficient, innovative, and sustainable strategies to mitigate carbon emissions in Vietnam universities.</p>
